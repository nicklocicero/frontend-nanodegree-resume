## Resume Project from Udacity Front-end JavaScript Basics

Basically uses a JS helper script and HTML site skeleton to build a webpage from a JSON object.  jQuery is also used.  So is Git and GitHub!

Google Maps API was added as well.

The script iterates through the JSON object and jQuery appends them to the right parts of the site!
